Description
Ever want to feel like a special forces pilot sneaking through the night skies with night vision?
Now you can! Introducing nightvision.lua for FlyWithLua in X-Plane 12 (cant guarantee it works in older releases), giving you that cool PVS-14 White Phosphor vibe right in the sim!
Night OPS, strobe off, here we come!
Be sure to keep an eye on your battery as you fly. Wouldn't want that night op to go dark without a good ole double-A in there.
Watch the demo to see how it works. Install instructions below

Installation Instructions
Download and extract the following files:
nightvision.lua
nightvision_on.wav
nightvision_off.wav
Extract the files and drag them into the folder:
nightvision.lua + nightvision_sounds folder â†’ Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts
Set up keybinding:
Navigate to Settings > Keyboard/Joystick
Search for "FlyWithLua/Nightvision"
Assign "Toggle" and "Show window" to your preferred button or key
Pro Tip: Aircraft equipped with infrared (IR) lights are specially designed for night vision use. Unlike regular lights, which emit visible wavelengths that can overwhelm Night Optical Devices (NODs), IR lights operate at wavelengths that are only visible through special night vision equipment.
Make sure to turn off your interior lights when using night vision! Standard cockpit or cabin lights will flood your NODs, causing them to bloom or temporarily "blind" you. Use dimmed, NVG-compatible lighting for the best experience.

How It Works
Night vision devices work by amplifying available light through an image intensifier tube. The tube captures small amounts of ambient light (starlight or moonlight) and intensifies it thousands of times to create a visible image. The enhanced image appears in grayscale, allowing clear vision in dark conditions.

Warning: Night vision is not designed for daylight use! Using it in bright conditions could result in poor visibility and unrealistic effects. For best results, use during night operations only.

This plugin may affect other FlyWithLua scripts due to visual dataref modifications.
