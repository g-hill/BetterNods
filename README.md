# NightVision.lua for X-Plane 12

## ✨ Description

Ever wanted to feel like a special forces pilot sneaking through the night skies with night vision? Now you can! Introducing **nightvision.lua** for FlyWithLua in X-Plane 12 (compatibility with older versions not guaranteed), bringing you that cool **PVS-14 White Phosphor** vibe right into the sim!

**Night OPS, strobe off—here we come!**

> Keep an eye on your battery as you fly—you wouldn't want your night op to go dark without a trusty double-A in there.

## 🛠 Installation Instructions

1. **Download and extract** the following files:
    - `nightvision.lua`
    - `nightvision_on.wav`
    - `nightvision_off.wav`

2. **Move the files** to the appropriate directory:
    ```
    nightvision.lua + nightvision_sounds folder → Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts
    ```

3. **Set up keybindings:**
    - Navigate to `Settings > Keyboard/Joystick`
    - Search for **FlyWithLua/Nightvision**
    - Assign `Toggle` and `Show window` to your preferred button or key

💡 **Pro Tip:** Aircraft equipped with infrared (IR) lights are specially designed for night vision use. Unlike regular lights, which emit visible wavelengths that can overwhelm Night Optical Devices (NODs), IR lights operate at wavelengths that are only visible through special night vision equipment.

> **Important:** Turn off your interior lights when using night vision! Standard cockpit or cabin lights will flood your NODs, causing bloom or temporary blindness. Use dimmed, NVG-compatible lighting for the best experience.

## 🛡 How It Works

Night vision devices work by amplifying available light through an **image intensifier tube**. This tube captures small amounts of ambient light (e.g., starlight or moonlight) and intensifies it thousands of times, creating a visible grayscale image for clear vision in dark conditions.

⚠️ **Warning:** Night vision is not designed for daylight use! Using it in bright conditions could result in poor visibility and unrealistic effects. For the best results, use it only during night operations.
